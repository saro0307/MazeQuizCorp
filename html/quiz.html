            There are two version revolving around the origin of Quiz, one is that<br \><br \>

            James Daly was a theatre manager in Dublin in 1782. He once had a bet with a friend that he could introduce a new word
            into the English language in a day. He then chalked the word "Quiz" on the walls of the city. Daly won the bet, and a
            useful word came out of it - in terms of vocabulary and Scrabble.<br \><br \>

            & the another version is that<br \><br \>

            The spelling quiz is recorded by 1886, though it was in use as a noun spelling from 1854, perhaps in this
            case from the slang word quiz "odd person".
