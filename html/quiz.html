                The origin of the word "Quiz" has two intriguing versions. One suggests that:
            </p>
            <p>
                James Daly, a theatre manager in Dublin in 1782, had a bet with a friend that he could introduce a new word
                into the English language in just one day. He then chalked the word "Quiz" on the walls of the city. Daly won the bet, 
                and a new word was born that enriched the English vocabulary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The alternative version dates the spelling of "quiz" back to 1886. Though it was used as a noun from 1854, it may have originated
                from the slang term "quiz," meaning "odd person."
